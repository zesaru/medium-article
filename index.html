    <h2>From Bootstrapping to Building a Brand that Scalese</h2>
    <p>Back in 2013, Sébastien, my brother Romain and I decided to launch a coding school to teach creative and entrepreneurially-minded people how to code their own tech products through an intensive 9-week bootcamp. At that time, none of us had real design or branding skills. My brother was a lawyer. Sébastien and I were both engineers (French engineers, aka the worst kind in terms of design background 😬).</p>

    <h2>Shipping our first logos 🙈</h2>
    <p>After a few drawings on a sheet of paper with a designer friend Julien, we quickly realized that a wagon is a poor design object 😬:</p>
    <p>It makes you think about underground, work, mine, gold rush, etc… not exactly the images we had in mind for our brand!.</p>

    <h2>Bootstrapping our brand</h2>
    <p>So, in 2013, we started growing our company without any proper brand system: just a logo and a name. As real “bootstrappers”, our approach was very pragmatic, though naive and lacking vision. We were just coming out with a new brand system on the fly for every new increment of our website.</p>
